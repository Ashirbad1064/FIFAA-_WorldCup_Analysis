# FIFAA_WorldCup_Analysis
The dataset contains data from every World Cup that has been played between the period 1930 - 2014. An important remark regarding the data, due to World War 2 the World Cup games that were planned for 1942 and 1946 were cancelled.
After carefully cleaning and wrangling the data in Excel, I imported the data into SQL to analyze the data and found some insights.

-The World Cup with the highest attendance was the World Cup that was held in 1994, and the lowest attendance was in 1934.
-Based on the numbers, I can confidently say that home-teams do perform better compared to away-teams. From my soccer knowledge, they get -to play in their choice of jersey and the home-team side gets to sell more tickets (in some instances).
-The attendance over the years has had growing trend, but also had minor setbacks.
-The amount of goals scored, did not increase by much, even though the number of matches played did have a steady increase.
